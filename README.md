## Structure
### Deliverables
Main Modeling Notebook: [2. model_building.ipynb](https://github.com/Richard-Yan-UCB/datasci281_final_project/blob/99a22decef31ae27fb2acd9810e9e36b332a74b4/2.%20model_building.ipynb)
- This is our main notebook, which contains our modeling framework, with references to supplementary notebooks for feature engineering.

### Supplementary Notebooks
These notebooks contain code for feature exploration and engineering.
- Canny Edge Feature Notebook: [canny_edges.ipynb](https://github.com/Richard-Yan-UCB/datasci281_final_project/blob/99a22decef31ae27fb2acd9810e9e36b332a74b4/canny_edges.ipynb)
- Blob Detection Features Notebook: [blob_detection.ipynb](https://github.com/Richard-Yan-UCB/datasci281_final_project/blob/99a22decef31ae27fb2acd9810e9e36b332a74b4/blob_detection.ipynb) (please download/pull to view)
- Complex Features Notebook: [complex_feat_extraction.ipynb](https://github.com/Richard-Yan-UCB/datasci281_final_project/blob/99a22decef31ae27fb2acd9810e9e36b332a74b4/complex_feat_extraction.ipynb) (please download/pull to view)
### Util Functions
Util Python File: [utils.py](https://github.com/Richard-Yan-UCB/datasci281_final_project/blob/99a22decef31ae27fb2acd9810e9e36b332a74b4/utils.py)
- We encapsulated all of the main logic for feature generation, model training/testing, results generation, and EDA in this Python file and imported them into the various notebooks.
### Appendix
Ensemble Framework Exploration Notebook: [ensemble_pipeline.ipynb](https://github.com/Richard-Yan-UCB/datasci281_final_project/blob/99a22decef31ae27fb2acd9810e9e36b332a74b4/ensemble_pipeline.ipynb)
- This notebook contains exploration of the ensemble framework.
